# 555 astable

<img align="right" src="../_common/PlaceholderImage.png">

A little board with a 555 timer IC and a few components around it to create an astable oscillator. The output of the oscillator is available on a header so it can be used of-board but there is also an LED so you can see it blinking. The components that control the oscillation frequency are through-hole components so they can be loaded and swapped out easily; the components you shouldn't need to change (including the 555 timer IC) are surface mount.
