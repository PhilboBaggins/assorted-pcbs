# Eurorack power screw terminals adapter

<img align="right" src="../_common/PlaceholderImage.png">

A power supply connector for Eurorack modular synthesizer connected to a block of screw terminals, so you can:

* Power your Eurorack synth modules by putting power into the screw terminals OR
* Breakout of the power supply rails from a Eurorack power supply (or power bus board) by using the screw terminals as power outputs

Also, there are some LEDs to indicate when power is present.

I made this board by cutting down [this existing design](../ATX%20to%20Eurorack%20power%20supply%20adaptor/).
