# Pine64 PADI to FTDI header adaptor

This is a quick and simple board designed to hold a [Pine64 PADI](https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=917) board and allow you to talk to it with a FTDI [TTL-232R-3V3](http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBTTLSerial.htm) cable while powering the PADI module from an external 3.3 volt power supply (via a screw terminal).

## Design files

This board was designed using the [Upverter](https://upverter.com) web service.

The schematic, board layout and bill of materials can be viewed [here](https://upverter.com/Trebuchetindustries/38c22eb1ff7e8e2d/Pine64-PADI-to-FTDI-header-adaptor/). Exports from Upverter are available in a subdirectory.

The bill of materials lists specific a part number for the 2 pin screw terminal block but really any old 2 pin screw terminal block with a 5mm pitch should work.
