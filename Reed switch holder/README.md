# Reed switch holder

This is a quick and simple board designed to hold 6 reed switches in a row, approximately equal distance apart so I can experiment with some spinning magnets for possible MIDI applications.

## Design files

This board was designed using the [Upverter](https://upverter.com) web service.

The schematic, board layout and bill of materials can be viewed [here](https://upverter.com/Trebuchetindustries/779c092dc3c8a9ac/Reed-switch-holder/). Exports from Upverter are available in a subdirectory.

The bill of materials lists specific part numbers for the 0.1" header and reed switches but really any old 0.1" header and reed switches should work.
