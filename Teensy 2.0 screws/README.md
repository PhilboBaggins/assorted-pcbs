# Teensy 2.0 screws

This is a quick and simple board designed to break out most of the pins on the [Teensy 2.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html) board to screw terminals.

I used 0.1" (2.54 mm) pitch screw terminals because it's the same pitch as the pins on the Teensy. I used three 4-pin terminal blocks along the long sides of the Teensy (rather than a single 12-pin terminal block) because they're more common and flexible ... and I already had several on hand.

When mounting the Teensy, it is important to make sure the Teensy's pins line up with the silkscreen labels on this PCB. An easy way to do this is to use the pin labelled "GND" on the top right of the Teensy board to align the Teensy with the screw terminal labelled "GND" on the top right of this PCB (as shown in the picture below).
